# Percentage-increase-calculator
A simple percentage increase calculator that takes a users input value and returns a value with a percentage increase. 
This was the first project I completed to full that was not a Front End Mentorchallenge. 
This project is the first version and I'm planning to refactor it to simplify the JS.i
Planned changes are to add a loop to the JS code around the .addEventListener to reduce the amount of repeated code. Potential changes may be made to the CSS to practice styling and design as this was not made to look nice but to practice event listeners.

Any suggested changes are welcome to improve the efficiency of the script and stylesheet.
